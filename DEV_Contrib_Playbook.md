# DEV_Contrib_Playbook

## Purpose
Establish guidelines for contributors to ensure high‑quality, consistent development of EVE‑RN.

## Contribution Workflow
1. **Issue Tracking**
   - Report bugs, feature requests and enhancement ideas via GitHub issues.
   - Use labels for layers (A1, A2, etc.), priority and type (bug, enhancement, documentation).

2. **Pull Requests (PRs)**
   - Fork the repository and create a feature branch.
   - Ensure your change adheres to the coding standards; include tests and documentation where applicable.
   - Reference related issues in the PR description.
   - Tag relevant reviewers; at least one maintainer must approve before merging.
   - Use conventional commit messages (e.g., `feat: add wormhole mapping schema`).

3. **Review Norms**
   - Be respectful and constructive; brogramming means we support each other.
   - Reviewers should check for correctness, clarity, security (e.g., proper API usage【119277652475160†L55-L59】), and adherence to taxonomies and schemas.
   - Suggest improvements rather than blocking unnecessarily; propose alternative implementations with justification.

4. **Tagging Rules**
   - Use the tag taxonomy (A1_Lore_TagTaxonomy) when labeling issues and PRs.
   - Keep tags up to date; propose new tags via issues if needed.

5. **Code of Conduct**
   - Follow the project's Code of Conduct; harassment, discrimination or toxicity are not tolerated.
   - Be mindful when discussing real-world politics; the platform’s focus is on a fictional universe.

6. **Documentation**
   - Update documentation whenever changes are made to schemas or processes.
   - Use the Brogramming Glossary for consistent terminology.

## Additional Guidelines
- Keep secrets out of the repository; store API keys or tokens in secure vaults.
- Write modular, testable code; avoid monolithic scripts.
- Celebrate contributions! Shout‑outs and memes are welcome in the social channels.
