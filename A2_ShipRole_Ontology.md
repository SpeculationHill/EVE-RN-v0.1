# A2_ShipRole_Ontology

## Purpose
Define an ontology of ship classes, roles, doctrines and common fits to power recommendations and analysis. Ships in EVE range from tiny frigates to titanic capital ships, each designed for specific roles in combat, industry or exploration.

## Ship Classes
- **Frigates**: Small, fast ships used for scouting, tackling and light combat. Includes Tech I, Tech II (e.g., interceptors, assault frigates) and Tech III (frigate‑sized strategic cruisers).
- **Destroyers**: Glass‑cannon ships with high damage output but low durability; used for anti‑frigate and small‑gang roles.
- **Cruisers**: Versatile mid‑sized ships including logistics (healers), electronic warfare, exploration and combat variants.
- **Battlecruisers**: Heavier hulls with increased firepower; command ships provide fleet boosts.
- **Battleships**: Large combat ships for sustained DPS or specialised roles (e.g., marauders).
- **Capitals & Supercapitals**: Carriers, Dreadnoughts, Force Auxiliaries, Titans – used in large‑scale warfare.
- **Industrial & Haulers**: Ships for moving cargo, mining, salvaging and planetary interaction.
- **Specialised Vessels**: Stealth bombers, Recon ships, Black Ops battleships, Command destroyers.

## Roles & Doctrines
- **DPS**: Damage‑dealing ships; may be short‑range brawlers or long‑range artillery/sniper fits.
- **Tackle**: Fast ships equipped with warp disruptors/scramblers and webs to pin targets.
- **Logistics (Logi)**: Support ships that repair shield or armour of fleetmates.
- **Electronic Warfare (EWAR)**: Ships that jam, damp, neut, or otherwise impair enemies.
- **Exploration**: Cloaky ships for scanning and hacking sites; often rely on wormholes【647673664077612†L154-L162】.
- **Industrial**: Mining barges, exhumers, and freighters used for resource extraction and transport.

## Implementation Notes
- Use tags to classify ships by race (Amarr, Caldari, Gallente, Minmatar) and hull size.  
- Document typical fits and doctrines; e.g., an interceptor fit emphasises speed and warp disruption, while a nano‑frigate uses modules to improve agility.
- Incorporate usage statistics (e.g., from killboards) to determine popular roles and propose fleet compositions.
