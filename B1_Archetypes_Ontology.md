3. **Industrialist**: Focus on mining, manufacturing, planetary industry and markets; values reliable access to resources and markets.
4. **PvP Learner**: Wants to learn combat; may join NPSI fleets or faction warfare【976944329353990†L113-L117】.
5. **Explorer**: Enjoys scanning, wormholes and relic/data sites; willing to venture into wormhole space (rifts in space connecting systems【647673664077612†L154-L162】).
6. **Mission Runner**: Prefers structured PvE missions for story and ISK (bounty faucet【940571151247159†L67-L74】).
7. **Null‑Sec Warrior**: Interested in sovereignty warfare, large fleet fights, politics and alliances.
8. **Wormhole Dweller**: Lives in w‑space; values self‑sufficiency and small‑gang PvP.
9. **Roleplayer/Lore Enthusiast**: Engages with EVE’s rich lore, participates in events and corp roleplay.

Each archetype includes:
- Skill level (beginner, intermediate, advanced).
- Preferred risk/reward ratio.
- Social preferences (solo vs. group).
- Typical time investment (casual vs. hardcore).
- Recommended starting path (e.g., Day‑1 Alpha → Career Agents → join Newbro Corp).

## Notes
- Archetypes are non-exclusive; players may evolve from one to another.
- Use tags to match archetypes with communities and activities.
