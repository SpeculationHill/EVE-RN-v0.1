# B1_Onboarding_Paths

## Purpose
Outline narrative onboarding paths tailored to each archetype. Paths are sequences of recommended steps, activities, tools and communities to help players progress in New Eden.

## Structure
Each path is a list of stages, each with:
- `stage_name`
- `objectives`
- `recommendedActivities` (from A2_Activities_Taxonomy)
- `recommendedTools` (from the tool index)
- `recommendedCommunities` (from A4_Communities_Taxonomy)
- `notes` (tips, warnings).

## Examples
- **Day‑1 Alpha Path**:
  1. **Career Agents**: Complete the tutorial and career agent missions to learn basic skills and earn initial ISK.
  2. **Join a Newbro-Friendly Corp**: EVE University or Brave Newbies to get mentorship.
  3. **Skill Development**: Train basic fitting, navigation and spaceship command; use tools like EVE OS and Pyfa to plan fits.
  4. **First Fleets**: Join public NPSI fleets【976944329353990†L113-L117】 to experience PvP in a low‑stakes environment.
- **Industrialist Path**:
  1. **Mining Ventures**: Start with high‑sec mining to learn ore types; use tools like OreProfit calculators.
  2. **Blueprint Research**: Learn manufacturing and invention; join industry‑focused corps.
  3. **Market Trade**: Engage in station trading; understand taxes and fees (an ISK sink【940571151247159†L83-L101】).
  4. **Scale Up**: Move to wormhole or null‑sec mining for higher yields; consider planetary industry.

## Implementation Notes
- Use the archetype’s attributes to adjust the difficulty and depth of each stage.
- Provide tooltips and warnings (e.g., always bookmark your entry wormhole【647673664077612†L168-L180】).
- Onboarding paths should be dynamic and update with game changes.
