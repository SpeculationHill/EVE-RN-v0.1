# A4_Communities_Taxonomy

## Purpose
Classify different types of player communities to aid discovery and recommendation. Communities include groups beyond formal corporations, such as public fleets, teaching organisations, and content creators.

## Community Types
- **NPSI Fleets**: Groups that host open "Not Purple Shoot It" fleets where any non‑fleet target may be engaged【976944329353990†L113-L117】. Examples: Bombers Bar, Spectre Fleet【976944329353990†L121-L149】.
- **Newbro/Newbie Friendly Corps**: Organisations designed to train new players (e.g., EVE University, Brave Newbies).
- **Industry & Mining Groups**: Corps/alliances focusing on industry and resource extraction.
- **Wormhole Communities**: Groups inhabiting wormhole space, from Class 1 to Class 6; may host mapping and rescue services.
- **Faction Warfare Militias**: Player militias aligned with Amarr, Caldari, Gallente or Minmatar factions.
- **Null‑Sec Alliances**: Sovereignty‑holding alliances and coalitions.
- **Roleplay Organisations**: Groups dedicated to in‑character play and lore (e.g., CVA, Ushra’Khan).
- **Event & Teaching Communities**: Entities like EVE University and NPSI Gateway that host classes, roams and community events.

## Tagging Rules
- A community may have multiple tags (e.g., Wormhole + Newbro Friendly).
- Use tags from the tag taxonomy where appropriate (e.g., Empire tags to indicate allegiance).
- Capture size and typical time zones to match with players.

## Implementation Notes
- Use social channel indexer (A4_SocialChannels_Indexer) to track community presence across Discord, Reddit and forums.
- Encourage community leaders to self‑categorise; validate via community feedback.
